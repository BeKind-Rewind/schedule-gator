# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the [Moment.js project status page.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<!-- COMPLETED -->

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
<!-- COMPLETED -->

<!-- TODO -->
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<!-- PARTIAL -->

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
<!-- COMPLETED -->


WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<!-- COMPLETED -->

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
<!-- COMPLETED -->
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
